## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker should be installed on your machine.
- Git should be installed on your machine.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kreative-Performative-Individuals/KPI-Engine.git
```

This will create a new directory named `KPI-Engine` in your current working directory.

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd KPI-Engine
```

Build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build --tag kpi-engine .
```

### 3. Run the Docker Container

Run the following command to start the KPI Engine Docker container:

```bash
 docker run -d --name KPI-Engine -p 8000:8000 kpi-engine 
```

This command will start a new Docker container named `KPI-Engine` and expose the application on port `8000`.

### 4. Access the API

You can now access the KPI Engine API by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser or using tools like Postman.

### 5. Stopping the Container

To stop the running container, use the following command:

```bash
docker stop KPI-Engine
```

Check the status of the container using the following command:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### 6. Removing the Container and the Image

To remove the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker rm KPI-Engine
```

To remove the image, use the following command:

```bash
docker rmi kpi-engine
```
